# HTML_Portfolio 🌐

This is my first HTML portfolio, which I created before diving into the comprehensive Udemy course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. At this stage, I have just completed the HTML5 section of the course, and I decided to build this small project to apply what I have learned so far. 🚀

About This Portfolio ℹ️
This portfolio serves as a practical application of the HTML skills I have acquired during the initial stages of the course. It showcases my progress in web development and will serve as a foundation for future enhancements and additions as I continue my web development journey.

What I've Covered So Far 📚
As of now, I have covered HTML5, which is the structure and markup of web pages. However, I have an exciting journey ahead in this web development bootcamp. Here are some of the topics I'm planning to delve into:

CSS: Styling and design to make web pages visually appealing. 🎨
JavaScript: Adding interactivity and functionality to websites. 💡
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript for building scalable applications. 🌐
React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ⚛️
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing data in web applications. 📊
Web3 and DApps: Exploring blockchain development and decentralized applications. 📡
Next Steps 🛤️
With a strong foundation in HTML and an array of exciting technologies to explore, I'm enthusiastic about advancing my web development skills. My immediate goal is to progress to CSS and JavaScript to enhance the interactivity and design of my web projects.

I will continue to update this portfolio as I make progress and develop new projects based on the knowledge gained in the course. Thank you for visiting, and stay tuned for more updates as I work my way through the course!

Note: This portfolio project is a simple demonstration of my HTML skills and is a work in progress. It will be continually updated as I learn more and improve my web development abilities. 🚧
